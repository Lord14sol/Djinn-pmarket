# Progress Tracker

## STATUS: VIBE CODING ADOPTION

### COMPLETED
- [x] Architecture Analysis (Old docs -> New docs)
- [x] Generated `CLAUDE.md` (Rules)
- [x] Generated `TECH_STACK.md` (Versions)
- [x] Generated `PRD.md` (Market/Oracle Scope)
- [x] Generated `FRONTEND_GUIDELINES.md` (Neon/Glass Design)
- [x] Generated `BACKEND_STRUCTURE.md` (Supabase + Anchor)
- [x] Generated `APP_FLOW.md` (User Journeys)
- [x] Generated `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (Roadmap)

### IN PROGRESS
- [ ] Syncing codebase with new documentation constraints.

### NEXT STEPS
1. Verify `lib/core-amm.ts` matches `BACKEND_STRUCTURE.md` constants.
2. Check `supabase/sql` against `BACKEND_STRUCTURE.md`.
3. Attempt Anchor Build (Rust Check).

### KNOWN ISSUES
- Smart Contract build failed previously due to Rust version (Needs 1.92+).
- "Local Mode" mocking in `supabase-db.ts` needs to be toggleable for production.
